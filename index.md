title: Welcome to my Digital Portfolio!
---

Hi friend! I made this for both you, the mysterious reader, and I to keep track of what **projects** and non-job things I've worked on. Here's what I've got up to so far: 

Computer Science stuff:
---------------

- **Topsy Turvy Project:**
  - I implemented a game called Topsy Turvy, inspired by Connect 4, with a unique move that flips all pieces on the board. I implemented two board representations: a memory-efficient bits representation and a matrix representation. I used multithreading to optimize for the matrix-based implementation, enhancing gameplay responsiveness.
 
- **Crusty DB:**
  - I learned how a database storage manager works by implementing a heappage, heapfile, storage manager in Rust for a relational database. I also implemented a simple nested loop join and a hash join for the DBMS.
 
- **Blokus Project:**
  - I implemented core game logic for Blokus in Python as part of a 4-person team, and improved player experience by independently creating a bot that simulated three different skill levels.
 
- **Citadel Capstone Project:**
  - I analyzed financial data using Microsoft Excel to assess volatility, returns, and correlations of 10 companies and cryptocurrencies, and contributed to the creation of a diversified investment portfolio with a focus on creating a stable portfolio.

For fun:
---------------
 - **"Untitled Ant Game"**
  - This is a basic platformer game I started last summer to implement the basics of game development with Unity. All coding, in C#, and art, done using Procreate, was done by myself. The current music I have is all copyright free music I found online, but I'd love to create my own soundtrack at some point.

 - **Unity Essentials Project:**
   - This project involved learning all of the basic capabilities of Unity including navigation in 3D and 2D space, creating and managing scenes, and understanding GameObjects, components, and prefabs. I also learned some basics like adding audio to scenes and how to publish a project to WebGL.

- **"Nighthawks with Hans"**
   - This was a bit different from what I'd usually do (coding or drawing related). I went around the Art Institute of Chicago and recorded using LMC Sony X70 Camera recording my friend wandering the museum. The real fun/difficult part was the editing of course which I did using Adobe Premiere Pro. Though recording and editing were both very new to me, it was really fun and I'd love to do it again.
 
What am I currently up to?
---------------

Well, I can't exactly disclose the details at the current moment for contractual reasons, but I'm currently working at a criminal justice non-profit for the summer. I'm also taking an Intro to DevOps class which I think is pretty cool since I think it'll help me do better at my on-campus job. It's also a part of CS I haven't explored much, so I'm excited to learn more about it!
